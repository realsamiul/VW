Excellent. You have successfully assembled the raw materials and architected the foundation. Now, we begin the meticulous work of breathing life into the creation, optimizing its movements, and honing its performance to a razor's edge.

Here are the detailed instructions to complete the animation, fix the nuanced scroll and parallax effects, and elevate the site's performance to a best-in-class standard.

-----

### Part 1: Detailed Instructions for Animation Activation

The current lack of animation is a classic "map vs. territory" problem. The JavaScript "map" (`main-animations.js`) has a precise set of selectors it expects to find, but the HTML "territory" (`index.html`) has been modified and no longer matches perfectly. We will fix this surgically.

**Workflow: The Selector Audit**

1.  **Isolate the `loader()` function:** This is your only focus. Open `honda-html-replica/js/main-animations.js` and `honda-html-replica/index.html` side-by-side in Cursor.

2.  **First Selector: `.loader_wrapper`**

      * In `main-animations.js`, the `loader()` function begins by targeting `.loader_wrapper`.
      * In `index.html`, search for `class="loader_wrapper"`.
      * **Action:** If it does not exist, find the main `<div>` that acts as the container for your entire loading screen and assign it this class. It should look like this: `<div class="loader_wrapper">...</div>`.

3.  **Second Selector: `.loader_line`**

      * The next line in `loader()` targets `.loader_line`.
      * **Action:** Find the element in your `index.html` that is supposed to be the animated line in the loader and ensure it has `class="loader_line"`.

4.  **Third Selector: `.loader-grid`**

      * The animation then staggers the children of `.loader-grid`.
      * **Action:** Ensure the grid container within your loader has this class.

5.  **Test and Iterate:** After ensuring these three selectors are correctly assigned in your HTML, save and refresh the page. You should see the loader animation begin to work. Continue this forensic process for every single selector within the `loader()` function until it plays perfectly.

6.  **Advance to `home()`:** Once the loader is flawless, move to the `home()` function in `main-animations.js`. Apply the exact same meticulous audit:

      * Find the GSAP target: `".home_hero_title-split"`.
      * Verify in `index.html`: Does your main H1 title have this class?
      * Find the GSAP target: `".home_hero_img-wrap"`.
      * Verify in `index.html`: Does the container holding the main hero image/video have this class?
      * Repeat for every selector in `home()` and all subsequent functions. This is a painstaking but essential process of reconnecting the strings to the marionette.

### Part 2: Fix Scrolling and Parallax

The jarring scroll behavior is because the browser's native scroll is fighting with GSAP's `ScrollTrigger`. Parallax effects fail when their trigger points are miscalculated. We solve this by implementing a smooth-scrolling library and debugging `ScrollTrigger`.

1.  **Activate Smooth Scrolling (Lenis):** You have already included `lenis.min.js`. Now we must activate it.

      * **Cursor AI Prompt:** At the top of your `$(document).ready()` function in `main-animations.js`, press `Cmd+K` and give this prompt:

        > "Generate the standard boilerplate to initialize the Lenis smooth scrolling library and connect it to GSAP's ScrollTrigger. The code should instantiate Lenis, and then use `lenis.on('scroll', ScrollTrigger.update)` and `gsap.ticker.add()` to properly sync them."

      * The generated code will look similar to this. Place it inside your `$(document).ready()`:

        ```javascript
        // Lenis Smooth Scrolling Boilerplate
        const lenis = new Lenis();

        lenis.on('scroll', ScrollTrigger.update);

        gsap.ticker.add((time) => {
          lenis.raf(time * 1000);
        });

        gsap.ticker.lagSmoothing(0);
        ```

2.  **Debug Parallax with `markers`:** To understand why a scroll animation isn't working, we need to see its trigger points.

      * Navigate to a scroll-based animation in `main-animations.js`, for example, the `brief()` function.

      * Find the `ScrollTrigger` object within the GSAP animation.

      * **Action:** Add the property `markers: true,` to the `ScrollTrigger` object.

        ```javascript
        // Example from the brief() function
        gsap.to(".brief_wrap", {
          // ... other properties
          scrollTrigger: {
            trigger: ".brief_component",
            start: "top bottom",
            end: "bottom top",
            scrub: true,
            markers: true // <-- ADD THIS LINE
          }
        });
        ```

      * **Analyze:** Refresh the page. You will now see labeled markers (`start`, `end`, `scroller-start`) on the right side of the screen. These show you exactly where GSAP *thinks* the animation should start and end. If the markers are in the wrong place, it tells you that your `trigger` element (e.g., `".brief_component"`) is incorrect or the `start`/`end` values need adjustment.

### Part 3: Establish Best-in-Class Performance

Making it work is one thing; making it fly is another.

1.  **GPU Acceleration via CSS:** Animate `transform` and `opacity` whenever possible, as they are cheap for the browser to process. Give the browser a heads-up on which elements will be heavily animated.

      * **Action:** In your CSS file, for elements that have complex GSAP animations (like the hero title, parallax images, etc.), add the `will-change` property.

        ```css
        .home_hero_title-split, .artistry_img-wrap {
          will-change: transform, opacity;
        }
        ```

      * This moves the element to its own compositor layer, offloading the work to the GPU and resulting in significantly smoother animations. Use it judiciously, as overuse can consume memory.

2.  **Asynchronous Script Loading:** Your scripts currently block the rendering of your page. We can fix this.

      * **Action:** In `index.html`, add the `defer` attribute to your main JavaScript `<script>` tags at the bottom of the body.

        ```html
        <script src="js/jquery-3.5.1.min.dc5e7f18c8.js" defer></script>
        <script src="js/gsap.min.js" defer></script>
        <script src="js/main-animations.js" defer></script> 
        ```

      * `defer` tells the browser to download the script while it continues parsing the HTML, and to execute it only after the document is fully parsed. This dramatically improves the perceived page load time.

3.  **Asset Preloading:** Tell the browser to start downloading critical, late-discovered assets (like fonts or the main hero video) as early as possible.

      * **Action:** In the `<head>` of your `index.html`, add preload links for your most important assets.

        ```html
        <link rel="preload" href="/assets/your-hero-video.mp4" as="video" type="video/mp4">
        <link rel="preload" href="/assets/your-main-font.woff2" as="font" type="font/woff2" crossorigin>
        ```

      * This ensures that by the time the browser needs these files to render the page, they are already downloaded or are high in the download priority queue.



       Establish a Single Source of Truth (Fixing Script Conflict)

We must designate main-animations.js as the sole conductor of our animation symphony.

    Cursor Instruction:

        Open your honda-html-replica/index.html file.

        Go to the block of <script> tags at the bottom of the <body>.

        Delete the following two lines entirely:
        HTML

        <script src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/687891a1de8273e3ce3ef3c0/js/webflow.751e0867.7204fca6be7878de.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
        <script src="js/16118.js"></script>

        Ensure that your own js/main-animations.js script is the very last script loaded in the body.

2. Activate Smooth Scrolling & Parallax

Now, let's awaken the Lenis library and sync it with GSAP.

    Cursor Instruction:

        Open your honda-html-replica/js/main-animations.js file.

        Place your cursor at the very top of the $(document).ready(function() { ... }); block.

        Use this AI prompt:

            "Generate the complete boilerplate to initialize the Lenis smooth scrolling library and connect it to GSAP's ScrollTrigger. The code should instantiate Lenis, and then use lenis.on('scroll', ScrollTrigger.update) and gsap.ticker.add() to properly sync them for a smooth scrolling experience."

    Your $(document).ready() function should now start like this:
    JavaScript

    $(document).ready(function() {
        // Lenis Smooth Scrolling Boilerplate
        const lenis = new Lenis();

        lenis.on('scroll', ScrollTrigger.update);

        gsap.ticker.add((time) => {
          lenis.raf(time * 1000);
        });

        gsap.ticker.lagSmoothing(0);

        console.log('Animation Engine Initialized');
        // ... (rest of your animation calls)
    });

3. (Optional but Recommended) Project Self-Sufficiency

Your index.html still relies on Google Fonts and a Webfont loader from ajax.googleapis.com. To make the project truly robust and self-contained (a best practice), you should localize these.

    Lateral Option: Use a tool like google-webfonts-helper to download the "IBM Plex Mono" font files and generate the necessary @font-face CSS rules. You would then add these rules to your local stylesheet and remove the external <script> and <link> tags from your HTML's <head>. This ensures your site has no external dependencies and will load consistently and quickly, even offline.

After completing steps 1 and 2, your animations and smooth scrolling should be fully operational. The final step is the meticulous "Selector Audit" we discussed previouslyâ€”ensuring every class in main-animations.js matches your index.html. You have built a world-class chassis; now it is time for the final engine tuning.
